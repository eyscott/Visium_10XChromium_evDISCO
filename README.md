# Analysis of 10X Visium, 10X Chromium and evDISCO RNA-seq data from mouse cortex post stroke (sub-acute)
These scripts detail out analysis of each dataset separately as well as the integration of 10X Visium and Chromium datasets

## Datasets
1) Visium= 4 samples (mouse brain): Day 2, Day 10 and Day 21 post-stroke samples plus a sham (day 2) 
2) 10X Chromium: scRNA-seq analysis on Glast+ astrocytes from around stroke injury area (cortex) from stroke and uninjured mouse
3) evDISCO: scRNA-seq analysis on Day 10 post-stroke mice (n=3), selected GFAP+ astrocytes at defined distances from stroke injury
![Progression of datasets]()*We started with the more broad Visium, then using 10X Chromium focused specifically on astrocytes (Glast+) at the sub-acute post-stroke time point. Lastly, we used evDISCO for astrocytes (GFAP+) at defined distances from the cortical stroke injury sites at the sub-acute timepoint*
